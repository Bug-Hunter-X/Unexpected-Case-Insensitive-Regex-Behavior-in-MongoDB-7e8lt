# Unexpected Case-Insensitive Regex Behavior in MongoDB

This example demonstrates an uncommon issue with case-insensitive regular expressions in MongoDB.  The issue stems from potential conflicts between how the regular expression engine handles special characters or edge cases within the regex pattern compared to other database systems. 

The original `bug.js` attempts to perform a case-insensitive search using a regular expression. However, it produces unexpected results due to how MongoDB interprets and handles regular expressions, especially in comparison to how other database systems may operate. 

The solution provided in `bugSolution.js` addresses the issue by ensuring the regex pattern is correct and addressing any potential conflicts by escaping special characters or using a different, more robust approach to case-insensitive searching.
